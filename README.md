# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
- The motivation for this project was to learn some of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while making a functional study guide to review as I'm learning to code better.
- The issue that is combatted is my lack of a study guide and my lack of coding experience.
- I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git/Github, and JavaScript. I also learned how to work through some bugs that appeared along the way.
